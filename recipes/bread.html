    <p>
        I have been making sourdough for several years now. 
        It is daunting at first but once you get past the part 
        where you have to keep a community of microscopic organisms a
        live and well, it's easy!
    </p>
    <p>The best part is that all you really need is flour, water and salt.</p>

    <ul> Ingredients
    <li>1 kg flour</li>
    <li>825g water</li>
    <li>225g sourdough starter</li>
    <li>25g Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>Steps
    <li>Add 700g water to bowl</li>
    <li>Add starter to water and mix</li>
    <li>Add flour to water and mix well to incorporate</li>
    <li>Once mixed thoroughly, let sit for 35 minutes to autolyze</li>
    <li>After autolyze, fold every 30-40 minutes until developed</li>
    <li>Turn out onto bench, pre-shape, let sit 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Final shape, bench rest and refrigerate overnight</li>
    <li>Bake at 450 degrees F for 45 minutes (remove lid after 30 minutes)</li>
    </ol>
